## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Verify Setup
```bash
# Check if Node.js is installed
node --version  # Should show v16+

# If not installed, download from:
# https://nodejs.org/
```

### Step 2: Test Your First Program
```bash
# Navigate to the starter kit
cd /Users/Harish.Muleva/project/experiments/m2m/dev-test-ops-pro/basics/reactjsstarterkit

# Run your first JavaScript program
node 00-environment-setup/hello-world.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
🎉 Hello, JavaScript!
Welcome to your coding journey!
Node.js version: v20.x.x
```

### Step 3: Follow the Path
```bash
# Read the getting started guide
cat GETTING_STARTED.md

# Or use the interactive runner
./run.sh
```

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

### ✅ **Iterative Learning**
Each iteration builds on the previous one. Don't skip ahead!

### ✅ **Hands-On Practice**
You learn by doing. Type the code yourself, don't copy-paste.

### ✅ **Self-Paced**
Go at your own speed. Some take 4 weeks, others 8 weeks. Both are fine!

### ✅ **Complete Examples**
Every concept has working code you can run immediately.

### ✅ **Real Projects**
Build actual applications, not just toy examples.

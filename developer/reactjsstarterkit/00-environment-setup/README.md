# 🧩 Iteration 0: Environment Setup

## 🎯 Goal
Set up your development environment and verify that JavaScript can run on your machine.

## 📚 What You'll Learn
- What is Node.js and why we need it
- How to run a JavaScript file from the terminal
- Using VS Code as your code editor
- Basic terminal/command line usage

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### 1. Install Node.js
- Download from: https://nodejs.org/
- Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version
- Verify installation:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### 2. Install VS Code
- Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Install recommended extensions:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier - Code formatter
  - JavaScript (ES6) code snippets

### 3. Open Terminal in VS Code
- **macOS/Linux**: `Ctrl + ` ` or View → Terminal
- **Windows**: `Ctrl + ` ` or View → Terminal

## 💻 Your First Task

### Step 1: Run the hello-world.js file
```bash
node hello-world.js
```

### Step 2: Modify the file
Open `hello-world.js` and change the message to your name.

### Step 3: Run it again
```bash
node hello-world.js
```

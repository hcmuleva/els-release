# Exec probe runs a command inside the container
# Exit code 0 = success, non-zero = failure

# Test:
# 1. Apply deployment
# 2. Watch logs:
#    kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
# 3. Simulate failure by removing health file:
#    kubectl exec <pod-name> -- rm /tmp/healthy
# 4. Watch pod restart:
#    kubectl get pods -w
# 5. After 3 failures (15s), pod restarts

# Use cases for exec probes:
# - Custom health check scripts
# - File-based health markers
# - Database connection checks
# - Complex validation logic
